# CarrRacing
CarrRacing is a repository of code for the CarRacing-v0 environment. I have been working on getting the enviornment running for a few months now without success. I included important scripts for running the enviornment. My goal is to successful deploy an agent in the enviornment to achieve a arbitrarily high score.
